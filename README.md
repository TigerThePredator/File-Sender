# File-Sender
This is a small Java project that I am currently working on. This program will allow you to access a data pool of files on a server through a client. The client should be able to send in requests to the server asking for data via the command line, and the server should be able to validate those requests and submit the data to the client.

# Usage/Installation
Since this program is written using the Eclipse IDE, both the source code and the compiled code are in two separate folders. Running this program is as easy as downloading or cloning this repository and running "java Start" in terminal while being inside the /bin/ directory. Modifying the source code is easy; you should be able to easily add this as a new project in eclipse, import it as another project in another Java IDE, or use your favorite text editor to edit the files under the /src/ directory.
